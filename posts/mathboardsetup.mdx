## Step 1: Install the software

There are multiple ways to install the software on your MathBoard. You can either use the <strong>MathBoard installer</strong> or you can install the software manually.

<br />
### Method 1 (easy)

First open Powershell (type powershell in the search bar).

Then you can copy the following command and paste it in your Powershell window:

```
irm https://www.robyte.me/macro/mathboard/setup | iex
```

<br />

If you get an error please run the following command in an Admin Powershell window:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestriced
```

<br />

After that you can <strong>enter number '1'</strong> and press enter to start the installation.

<br />

### Method 2 (manual)

Coming soon!

<br />

## Step 2: Connect your MathBoard

Now you can connect you MathBoard to your computer (don't worry if you already connected it before, you can just leave it connected).

After that press the WINDOWS key + R key and type in the following

/>

<br />

Then create a new file <strong>'mathboard.bat'</strong> and paste the following code in it:

(Make sure you change the username to your own username in both lines ex. robin.aerts)

```
cd "C:\Users\robin.aerts\AppData\Roaming\Robyte\mathboard\luamacros"
LuaMacros.exe -r "C:\Users\robin.aerts\AppData\Roaming\Robyte\mathboard\lua_macro_script.lua"
```

Then double click on the file to run it. The next time this will automatically run when your pc starts.

<br />

## Step 3: Specificy the keyboard

Now you can specify the keyboard you want to use. You can do this by opening the MathBoard script in the app tray. (little arrow in the bottom right corner -> click the keyboard)

<BlogImage

  width="268"
  height="250"
/>

<br />

At the bottom you now see all the keyboards connected to your pc. If you're using a laptop, you will now see two entries (0 and 1).

Now you have to extract the little keyboard id withing the SystemId field. It's located
between two & symbols and is between 7 and 8 characters long.

<Hint>Make sure you don't select your laptop keyboard!</Hint>

You can copy this ID, paste it at the top in the keyboardIdentifier variable between the '' and press the Run icon.

<br />

<br />

Congratulations! Your mathboard is now setup and ready to use!

# Usage & Common Issues

You can use the keyboard in Microsoft Word.

To start typing an equation press the 'Start' key in the upper left corner.

Now you can use any Math-related key on the keyboard and it will automatically get converted into the desired output.

<br />

## Common Issues

A. If a random letter is typed along your equation, you should restart your computer and everything should work fine.

B. Some keys, like the {} key don't work, this problem is being solved as we speak.
