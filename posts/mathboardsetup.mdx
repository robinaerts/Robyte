## Step 1: Install the software

First you have to install the MathBoard software. You can download it [here](https://robyte.me/products/mathboard/Install_Mathboard.exe).
It's possible that your browser will warn you that the file is dangerous, but don't worry, that's just because the software isn't downloaded much.

Then you can double click on the .exe file. Here again it's possible that a blue screen pops up, but don't worry, just click on 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.

<br />

## Step 2: Specificy the keyboard

Now you can specify the keyboard you want to use. You can do this by double clicking the MathBoard script in the app tray. (little arrow in the bottom right corner -> click the keyboard with square root)

<br />

Next, connect your keyboard to your laptop. You should see a new device appear. Click on it and then give it a name. (e.g. mathBoard) and the ID has to be set to 1.
Click 'Add' and restart your PC.

Congratulations! Your mathboard is now setup and ready to use!

# Usage

You can use the keyboard in Microsoft Word.

To start typing an equation press the 'Start' key in the upper left corner.

Now you can use any Math-related key on the keyboard and it will automatically get converted into the desired output.
