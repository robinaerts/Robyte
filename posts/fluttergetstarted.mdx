You want to create an application that should be cross-platform, but you don't want to rewrite your app for all the different platforms out there?
Then don't look any further, because Flutter is the right choise for you! 

<br/>

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit">SDK</a> that was created by Google.

It's build on top op the <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)">Dart programming language</a>
and is meant to develop applications for a variety of <a target="blank" href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/release-notes/supported-platforms">different platforms</a> from a single codebase.

This removes the need for rebuilding an application for every platform you want to support and can decrease development time drastically.

<br/>

## Install Flutter

To install flutter, I recommend you to follow <a target="blank" href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">this official guide</a> to set it up for your OS.
After you've installed it, you can confirm the installation by running:
```bash
flutter doctor
```
If no errors come up, you're good to go!

## Building your first Flutter app

### Creating a new Flutter project
If you want to create a new Flutter application, you should run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
flutter create myApplication
```

After it's done you can open it in your IDE, I prefer VScode, but Android Studio is also a great choise.
